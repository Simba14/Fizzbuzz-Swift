# FizzBuzz in Swift!

My first attempt at using Swift, the general purpose language developed by Apple, by completing the infamous FizzBuzz kata.

I followed the [Getting Started with TDD in Swift 3](https://medium.com/@ynzc/getting-started-with-tdd-in-swift-2fab3e07204b) tutorial, which I highly recommend to anyone looking to dive into the world of Swift.

## Rules of FizzBuzz

The aim of the game is to count up as high as you can, starting at 1.

If the next number is a multiple of 3, tap the “Fizz” button.

If the next number is a multiple of 5, tap the “Buzz” button.

If the next number is a multiple of 3 AND 5, tap the “FizzBuzz” button.
